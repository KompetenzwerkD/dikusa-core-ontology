# Example data

## Data files for better understanding
* core_ontology_howto.ttl
* core_ontology_howto_no_rdfstar.ttl

Both files contain typical use cases for the ontology to foster better understanding of its usage. In the latter file all RDF-star statements have been removed.

## Data files for validation 
* core_ontology_instance_data_IRI.ttl 
* core_ontology_instance_data_IRI_with_error.ttl

Both files can be validated against the core ontology-schema based on the integrated SHACLE-constraints. The first will be successfully validated while the second will throw errors.
